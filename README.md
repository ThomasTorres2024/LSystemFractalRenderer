# LSystemFractalRenderer
I used some turtling and tkinter to allow users to graph L-System fractals (iterative fractals based on permuting characters in a sequence with each iteration) either from a set of already defined and well known L-sys fractals or by randomly generating Koch-Style fractals.

# NOTE
This is a fairly old program I made 2 years ago, but I wanted to at least get the random and set parts working again.
